            Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men, women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups
            in the United States. One person dies every 37 seconds in the United States from cardiovascular disease.
            About 647,000 Americans die from heart disease each yearâ€”that's 1 in every 4 deaths.
            https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm
            
            In my project I used features importance to find out which of them are more important in predicting
            a heart disease
